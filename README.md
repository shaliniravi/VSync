# VSync
The main idea of this project is to develop an android application VSync, which would have a virtual hangout session which allows synchronized video playback and messaging between groups.  With this application, we can watch a video together with our friends in different places at the same time and also share the opinion about it through text messages. For example, if one person starts playing the video before the other starts, then the video of the first person will pause/wait till the other person reaches the same point. And if one person pauses the video, it will automatically pause the video in other devices. This application provides people more comfort in their interpersonal interaction.
